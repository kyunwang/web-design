# Test result
These are the problems testers encountered which are to be fixed:
- [x] At the start the name is displayed as link to continue to the next step of the form which is not clear.
- [x] When selecting *Taiwan* in the form the prototype breaks.
- [x] The navigation is unclear (in the form)
- [x] A back button is missing from the bookmark page
- [ ] Clarity is missing
- [x] The previous and next buttons are not clean in the form - change the labels
- [x] It is unclear where the article without image belongs to
- [ ] Header title and article title are clashing for dominance/hierarchy
- [ ] Context is lost over the bookmarks as the link to the bookmark is at the top of the page only
