# Introduction
In this project for the minor the principle of *Exclusive design* has to be applied. This will be done by *focusing/constraining* myself by designing for a specific user(s).

<!-- Principle of http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/ too? -->
<!-- Principles of ai too? e.g. browsing behaviour and sort/filtering -->

# Getting started
Here is how to get started with this project

## Contents
The content is divided per section and is in:
- Text
- Few images
- Text behind a toggle (I count this as a type content)

![](doc/images/content.jpg)
The cards on the right are the items under the section *lesprogramma* which has ten toggle items.

## Sorted
The sorted cards are will be show here


# User scenario
The user scenario will clarify the goal and tasks. There are two user scenarios for this project:

## Marie
From the case:
>Marie is a graphic designer. She is Deaf, with capital D. This means that her first language is Dutch Sign Language. Quite a few of the hurdles she faces have to do with the fact that spoken/written Dutch is not her first language.

This means that that the difference between the Dutch Sign Language and Dutch can be a barrier for understanding.

**Scenario:** Marie want to learn about the Minor and without too much hassle. She doesn't want to get stuck with jargon.

**Goal:** Deliver clear and consice content for Marie(and other Deaf) to show what this minor is all about.

## Potential minor student
**The potential student is a ICT student at the HvA**

The ICT Student at HvA and CMD(The minor is hosted by CMD) student learn different but similar things. A ICT student might be interested in the minor Everything web and wants to learn more about the minor.

**Scenario:** The ICT student is looking for a Minor and is interested in the Minor Everything Web. He/She want to learn more about the contents and opinions of other students to form his/her own opinion before making his/her decision.

**Goal:** Showcase the minor with content to instill curiousity for the potential student. The student needs to be able to contact someone or sign in.
